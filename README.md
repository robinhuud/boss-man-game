# boss-man-game

Tiny VR Game using only gaze for input
Currently runs on Android GearVR, Oculus, and Fove.
currently implemented:
items can be gazed at to select them, using overdraw shader to indicate highlight.
improvements in upcoming releases are:
rework control panel to have more fun impacts in the room
like trap doors, money drop, kittens, etc..
create animated characters who enter the room and respond to voice commands
use Media Tuners APIs to integrate server-based conversation engine for diferent characters:
assistant, disgruntled employees, government inspectors etc...
figure out scoring system to make a fun and challengin game:
you are the boss man, use your power and influence to control your lackeys, punish your enimies and make capitalism work for you!
bribe officials, open a trap door under a people who are inconvenient. make big profits.

lots of work to do!
